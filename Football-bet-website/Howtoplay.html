                <h2>Game Description</h2>
                <p>Paris Publics is a platform where football enthusiasts can test their knowledge and have fun by
                    challenging each other on match outcomes. You can challenge an opponent on either the overall result
                    (winner/draw) or the exact score of a match.</p>

                <h2>How to Play</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>You must pay a stake of 1 Bronze Star to create a challenge for the overall result. For an exact
                        score challenge, both players pay 2Bronze Stars.</li>
                    <li>If you correctly predict the overall result, you win your opponent's stake.</li>
                    <li>If you correctly predict the exact score, you win twice your opponent's stake (your opponent's
                        stake + an equal amount from us).</li>
                    <li>If you create a challenge and no one accepts it, you will get your stake back, minus a small fee
                        of 1 or 2 Bronze Stars, depending on the bet type.</li>
                    <li>If both you and your opponent predict the wrong overall result, you both lose your stakes.</li>
                    <li>If both you and your opponent predict the wrong exact score, you both get your stakes back.</li>
                    <li>Bets must be placed at least 3 hours before the start of the match; after that, they will be
                        closed.</li>
                </ul>
